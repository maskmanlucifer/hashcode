### :rocket: hashcode
    hashcode is a website developed for creating and attempting virtual contest cooked using codeforces problems.
    The major functions of website relies on communication with codeforces API.
    Features of hashcode are -- 
    1. Creating public/private , mashup/lockout virtual contests.
    2. Various useful links of competitive programming in organized way.
    3. List of some most frequent STL functions.
    4. Collection of good to know one liner facts of competitive programming.

### :dart: In future features: 
    Here is the list of the features which can be added in hashcode in future--
    1. Building some interface to find coding buddies of same goal and interest.
